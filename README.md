# AT28C256_programmer
EEPROM Programmer Project. First step into "old scool" 6502 adventure

The programmers hardware design is based on Ben Eaters 6502 programmer. Check it out. It's a great project.
On top comes the Arduino software and win cli tool.

## Compatibility List:
The only EEPROM currently compatible with this program is:
- AT28C256 (who would have thought) with 32K of Memory

Note: this is hardcoded, but will eventually be variable
