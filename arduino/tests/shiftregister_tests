Mesurement flaws: arduino micros() function has only resolution of 4µs.. So changes can only be approximated.


Mesurement 1: entire writeTimedProperly(...) function

test writeTimedProperly
Write took: 384µs.
value: 7F
w

==> One Write op takes: 384µs.. There is way too much overhead. Maximum write time allowed to be in page write is 150µs, before it fails.
==> The overhead has to be trimmed down. Probably the shiftOut function takes to much time

Mesurement 2: setAddr(...) function

test writeTimedProperly
Address set took: 316µs.
w

==> Yes. Overhead comes from the setAddr(...) function. Because nops are very fast and digitalWrite is probably also, directly checking time of two, then one shiftOut 

Mesurement 3: both shiftOut() functions

test writeTimedProperly
Address set took: 304µs.
w

Mesurement 4: one shiftOut() function:
test writeTimedProperly
Address set took: 152µs.
w

==> As thought, the shiftOut functions provide most of the overhead. About 10µs are taken for nops and digitalWrite.
==> One shiftOut is already longer, than the threshold for a page write stop.
==> Solution: write custom shift out code, thats faster.
==> Theroretical limit: 
    - The registers are fast enough, to accept a new bit in each clock cycle.
    - 16 bis + 1 latch signal + 2nops for the data to stabilize => 19*62.5ns = 1.187µs...
    ==> So there should be plenty of time to shift the data under 50µs.
    - Rest of the codes overhead would be (as mesured): 80µs
    - 80µs + 50µs = 130µs 
    - so 20µs of wiggle room is plenty.


Codesample 1: basically both shiftOut but directly in code and also trimmed the MSBFIRST check away.

wtest writeTimedProperly
Custom 1: Address set took: 304µs.

==> Basically no difference to two shiftOuts()

Codesample 2: eliminate != 0 check. Data is still valid. 
=> no difference or 4µs less..
=> each loop exec takes about 18µs. from where?

Codesample 3:
firstly: mesure digitalWrite and lsl
digitalWrite: between 4 and 8 µs (probably around 5-6) https://roboticsbackend.com/arduino-fast-digitalwrite/: 3.4µs
lsl: between 0 and 4 µs (probably around 0-1)
==> do digitalWrite on a lower level. (with ports)

Idea: Directly write to PORTD (https://roboticsbackend.com/arduino-fast-digitalwrite/)

test writeTimedProperly
Custom 3: Address set took: 92µs.
w

==> Eliminating the clock digi writes takes away a lot of overhead.
==> 212µs saved. Still about 42µs too slow.

Codesample 4: 
the last digitalWrite..

wtest writeTimedProperly
Custom 4: Address set took: 16µs.

==> yeay. 16µs is definitly under my set mark of 50µs. Multiple tests show repeatable results.
